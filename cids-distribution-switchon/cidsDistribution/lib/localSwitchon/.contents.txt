Local runtime dependent configuration template JARs (empty JARs) for custom cids-distribution 
containers (local on docker host).

Local runtime dependent configurations are not part of the image but need to be present 
during automated builds of AUTO DISTRIBUTIONS since they are put into the lib/classpath JARs! 

When building an AUTO DISTRIBUTION, the JARs in this directory are copied into the image to lib/local.
The cids maven plugin adds those local dependencies to lib/classpath JARs and the client JNLPs. When the
container is started,  the empty JAR in container:lib/local are overlayed with the actual JAR from the host-mounted volume.

custom cids-distributions may use their own local.scaffold directories e.g. .localSwitchon.template
